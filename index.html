        <h1>Travelling abroad getting tougher for Biman employees</h1>

        <p id="biman">Biman Bangladesh Airlines today declared that all its employees, including cockpit crew, will have to get approval from its managing director and <b>CEO </b>before travelling abroad, no matter the reason.Earlier, chiefs of the respective departments had the authority to approve their subordinates for foreign visits, Biman MD and CEO Shafiul Azim told The Daily Star tonight.In an administrative order that came into force with immediate effect, Biman also set certain conditions for all of its employees to visit abroad.The national flag carrier came up with the new order following the visit of a Biman employee, Anwar Hossain, an assistant manager (admin), to Canada in October last year, said the Biman MD.

        On January 15, Biman filed a case with the Airport Police Station alleging that Anwar Hossain went to Canada without the permission of its authorities, which affected the flag carrier negatively.
            
        The allegation, however, was refuted by Anwar.According to the new decision, all employees (including cockpit crew) may visit outside Bangladesh either for better treatment of the applicant himself or along with his family members as an attendant, to visit places of religious importance once every two years, or to visit near relatives or tourist places twice a year.

        The employees will have to apply to the admin cell concerned, and then the application will go through the security and foreign affairs departments to receive the necessary security clearance and approval for the visit outside the country.
        
        "If I don't become tough, I will not be able to check the loopholes in getting approvals for foreign visits. I had no alternative but to take such a tough stance," said Biman MD.</pre>

        <img src="https://tds-images.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/big_202/public/images/2023/11/03/metro.jpg" alt="metro rail">
        <p id="metro">The MRT-6 is going to be open for 12 hours a day, six days a week from January 20, as revealed by the Dhaka Metro Transit Company Limited (DMTCL) today.The MRT-6 primarily serves a major corridor of the city, specifically for residents in Uttara and Mirpur who need to commute for work to Farmgate, Karwan Bazar, Bangladesh Secretariat or Motijheel. For the rest of the city, a series of metro lines are planned in the near future.For now, however, it is still possible for commuters to use the metro to their advantage even if they don't live in the areas covered by it, as long as they can figure out the station closest to them and can get there using public transport.</p>
